## 🏢 Who We Are

**BB Software Corporation** is a technology-focused organization dedicated to building **reliable, efficient, and thoughtfully engineered software**.

We focus on **practical systems**, **clean design**, and **long-term maintainability** rather than short-lived trends.

Our work spans from low-level engineering to user-facing applications, always with an emphasis on clarity and control.

## 🧭 Philosophy

> Software should be understandable, durable, and respectful of both users and developers.

We believe that:

- Good software favors **simplicity over complexity**
- Performance and usability are not trade-offs
